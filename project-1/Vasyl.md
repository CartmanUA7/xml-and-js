# Project 1

- Create automotive.xml out of automotive.json
    - Use online tools to perform the initial conversion
    - Give automatically generated tags more meaningful names
        - root -> retailers
        - row -> retailer
    - Refactor lists
        - list of `<carModels>` -> `<carModels>` with a list of `<carModel>` inside
        - list of `<cars>` -> `<cars>` with a list of `<car>` inside
    - Change `<id>` and `<vin>` elements to attributes
    - Validate final xml online
- Create xsd for created xml file
    - Create a root `<retailers>` element with a sequence of the newly defined `RetailerType` elements for `<retailer>` tag
    - Create a separate complex type element `RetailerType`, define all elements of the `<retailer>` tag, define new types `CarModelType` and `CarType` to describe them separately, and define a unique `id` attribute
    - Similarly, create separate complex types for `CarModelType` and `CarType`, define all their elements and unique attributes: `id` for `<carModel>` and `vin` for `<car>`
    - Validate final xsd online
- Create xslt to display data in the table format
    - Create page header and a table with predefiened column headers for retailers
    - Create `<xsl:for-each select="retailers/retailer">` loop to add each retailer and their attributes to the table
    - Create a new table with predefiened column headers for each retailer to display all available models
    - Create a nested `<xsl:for-each select="carModels/carModel">` loop to fill the models table with the corresponding data
    - Create an unordered list in the last column of retailers table to display the information about sold vehicle
    - Create another nested `<xsl:for-each select="cars/car">` loop to fill the list
    - Add background color to columns of both tables to improve readability
    - Add some style to the names of retailers
    - Remove some margins to save space
